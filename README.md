This project is a part of my diploma thesis focused on building a modern web application for efficient branch planning and management in Jenkins. The goal is to provide development and QA teams with a user-friendly interface to manage Jenkins branches, assign testing profiles, and schedule executions in a structured and automated way.

The application features a React-based frontend and a Spring Boot backend with PostgreSQL for persistent data storage. It supports dynamic triggering of Jenkins jobs through a REST API, integration with GitLab for automated issue creation, and caching mechanisms via Redis to optimize performance. Instead of using static JSON files, the project leverages a proper database architecture to demonstrate real-world software design. This system enables efficient collaboration between developers and testers while offering a scalable and maintainable approach to CI/CD pipeline management.
